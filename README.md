# Insurance Claim Classification using Logistic Regression

## Objective
Build a classification model to predict whether a customer will file an insurance claim.

## Dataset
The dataset contains demographic and insurance-related features such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, charges, etc.

## Approach
- Data loading and exploration
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling
- Logistic Regression model training
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of ~81% on the test dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Handle class imbalance
